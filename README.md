## Data Engineering Udacity Nano-degree Projects
### Introduction
This repository contains 6 projects. These projects were part of the nanodegree data engineering program, designed by Udacity.<br>
These projects introduces a hands on experience using real data and how we can model it to answer real world challenging use cases, starting from
simple relational data-models until data warehouse architectures, data-lakes and automated data pipelines using several aws services.<br>
 
### Projects
#### 1. Data Modeling with Postgres
During this project, I modelled user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app.<br>
Also, I defined Fact and Dimension tables and inserted data into new tables.
 
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, <b>Postgres</b>, <b>SQL</b>.
 
#### 2. Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
During this project, I modelled an event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app.<br>
Also, I defined queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.
 
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, <b>CQL</b>, <b>Apache Cassandra</b>.
 
#### 3. Cloud Data Warehouse
During this project, I built an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytical teams.
 
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>Postgres</b>, <b>Redshift</b>, <b>S3</b>.
 
#### 4. Data Lake with Apache Spark
During this project, I built a data lake and an ETL pipeline in Spark that loads data from S3, processes the data into analytics tables on an EMR cluster, and loads them back into S3.
 
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>Apache Spark</b>, <b>S3</b>, <b>EMR</b>.
 
#### 5. Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow
During this project, I worked on a music streaming companyâ€™s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines with Airflow, monitoring and debugging production pipelines.
 
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>Apache Airflow</b>, <b>S3</b>, <b>Redshift</b>.
 
#### 6. Capstone Project
In this Capstone project, I defined the scope of the project and the data I worked with to demonstrate what I have learned in this Data Engineering Nanodegree.
* Tools and Technologies: <b>Python</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>Apache Spark</b>, <b>S3</b>.
